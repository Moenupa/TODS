Yes .", "#C#: ", "#D#: A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever .", "#B#: Yes .", "#D#: Okay can we go to the next slide please ?", "#D#: Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas", "#D#: and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible .", "#D#: So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything .", "#A#: ", "#D#: I'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control", "#D#: what'll be", "#D#: And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible .", "#D#: At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the T_V_ , the V_C_R_ , the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp .", "#A#: Uh okay , can can I at this point interject um something ?", "#D#: I have to wind up ?", "#D#: Yeah , sure .", "#A#: Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered .", "#D#: Okay .", "#A#: Um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext ,", "#A#: because that's sort of outdated with the internet ,", "#D#: Okay .", "#C#: Mm-hmm .", "#A#: and according to to higher management the it should only control the T_V_ ,", "#D#: ", "#A#: mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things ,", "#C#: Complicated , yeah , of course .", "#A#: and they are concerned with the time to market .", "#C#: Yeah .", "#D#: Of course , yeah .", "#B#: Okay .", "#A#: Okay .", "#A#: Um and the", "#D#: Okay , so that's something", "#A#: and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product ,", "#A#: so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company , and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out .", "#C#: Mm-hmm .", "#A#: So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at .", "#A#: These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things ,", "#A#: so it's only gonna be T_V_ ,", "#D#: Okay", "#D#: so", "#A#: but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea .", "#D#: Okay .", "#A#: Mm 'kay .", "#B#: Okay .", "#D#: Alright ,", "#D#: thanks for that .", "#D#: Um alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now .", "#D#: 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use ,", "#D#: and that was thirty four percent", "#D#: but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room .", "#D#: Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address ,", "#D#: uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible ,", "#D#: we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use ,", "#D#: and then the things about finding it", "#D#: we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep ,", "#D#: and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate .", "#D#: 'Kay can we go to the next slide please ?", "#D#: Okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle .", "#D#: That is the selling point , the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase .", "#D#: Uh because once there's no be-back ,", "#D#: well in sales they always say you know , be-backs don't come back .", "#C#: ", "#D#: If somebody says , oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead .", "#D#: They're never gonna come back and buy it .", "#D#: You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w", "#D#: now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing .", "#D#: And , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use .", "#D#: We have to have as few buttons as possible ,", "#D#: because more buttons is more confusion ,", "#D#: so that's why I'm saying , simplicity is good .", "#D#: Finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it .", "#D#: So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it ,", "#D#: and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here ,", "#D#: it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros .", "#D#: So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that .", "#D#: Has to be so great that they're gonna say , uh twenty five Euros isn't much .", "#D#: Um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign .", "#C#: Yeah .", "#D#: Okay that's uh about it for me right now .", "#A#: Okay .", "#A#: And uh", "#A#: who would be next , uh ,", "#A#: I guess that would be you .", "#C#: Yeah 'kay .", "#A#: Mm-hmm .", "#A#: You want me to get your slide show up ?", "#C#: Yeah yeah sure .", "#A#: Mm-hmm .", "#C#: Thank you .", "#A#: And you are number three ?", "#C#: Number two ,", "#A#: Number two .", "#C#: yeah .", "#C#: Yeah exactly .", "#A#: Okay .", "#C#: Uh can you make it uh full screen please ?", "#A#: Okay .", "#A#: Mm-hmm .", "#A#: Yep .", "#C#: No ,", "#C#: it's like a", "#C#: well you you have to press here .", "#D#: ", "#C#: The cup cup shape here ?", "#A#: Yeah yeah , uh-huh .", "#C#: The thir third .", "#C#: Yeah exactly .", "#A#: There , mm-hmm .", "#C#: Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller .", "#D#: Okay .", "#C#: Um can you go to the next sli slide please ?", "#A#: Mm-hmm .", "#C#: The metal is like uh", "#C#: in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller .", "#C#: It takes the power from a battery", "#C#: say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that .", "#C#: It should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want", "#D#: Mm-hmm .", "#C#: and then um uh th", "#C#: this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source", "#C#: and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller", "#C#: and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a T_V_ or a air conditioner , something like that so .", "#C#: Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device .", "#C#: If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency", "#C#: like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency", "#C#: the device should know what the frequency is .", "#C#: It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action", "#C#: like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal ,", "#D#: Signal .", "#C#: and the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control", "#B#: Receive .", "#D#: Mm-hmm .", "#A#: Mm-hmm .", "#C#: and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices .", "#B#: Multi-purpose .", "#D#: Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management , so we're off the hook .", "#A#: Yo and it's", "#A#: yeah", "#C#: Uh yeah .", "#A#: but it's so .", "#C#: ", "#C#: Um .", "#A#: Yep .", "#C#: So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages", "#C#: like there should be a user user in interface", "#C#: like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there .", "#C#: So uh you can control whatever you want ,", "#C#: you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit", "#C#: so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions .", "#D#: Mm okay .", "#C#: So can you go to the next slide please ?", "#D#: Okay .", "#C#: So I I just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller", "#D#: Mm-hmm .", "#C#: um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also ,", "#C#: it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent", "#D#: Mm-hmm .", "#C#: uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark .", "#C#: And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed", "#C#: if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so .", "#C#: And there should be a child lock ,", "#C#: like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then
