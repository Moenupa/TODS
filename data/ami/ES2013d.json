"#B#: Um the the case", "#B#: oops ,", "#C#: ", "#B#: that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype .", "#B#: The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic .", "#B#: We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two ,", "#B#: but it can be either of those .", "#B#: We have the technology to do that .", "#B#: Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture .", "#B#: We have simple rubber push buttons", "#B#: um which provide all the functionality we need .", "#B#: Um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end ,", "#B#: it's the stalk of the banana ,", "#B#: or it's just the thing at the end of this version .", "#B#: Um so", "#B#: that's for material .", "#B#: Colour , well uh Steph's the expert on colour .", "#B#: Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that .", "#B#: Yeah ,", "#B#: I think that's all we've got to say really .", "#C#: I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped .", "#C#: This one has n", "#B#: A banana .", "#C#: banana , yeah .", "#C#: This one has no obvious connections to fruit ,", "#C#: but because it's round and molded ,", "#C#: it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie ,", "#C#: it's more like", "#C#: yeah ,", "#C#: you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta

right .", "#A#: yeah .", "#C#: Well you see ,", "#C#: that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it ,", "#C#: because then it'd just be rigid .", "#D#: I like the fact that on both of

Whether to have rubber or plastic buttons.", "QASumm": "The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. The user interface designer and industrial designer then presented two prototypes of the remote the team is working on and discussed the options for components and materials to include in their design. The first prototype featured a simple design with only a small number of buttons. The second prototype was shaped like a banana and used scroll push button technology. The marketing expert then led the team in conducting a product evaluation of the prototypes in which the prototypes were evaluated on the basis of their fanciness, technological innovation, ease of use, trendiness, and marketability. Overall, the prototypes performed quite well in the evaluation. The project manager then examined the production costs of the remote. The cost to produce the remote was 9.20 pounds and did not exceed the project budget. The team then conducted an evaluation of the project process, in which they indicated that they were quite happy with the tools available to them, the ideas they came up with, and their teamwork.",
